    "I defined the solution for the rotation transformation in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Get the dimension from the image's shape, then calculate the center of the image and set up the transformation matrix\n",
    "2. Then I compute the new image's dimensions based on the transformation to accommodate the changes. This was based on a combination of trial and error and trying to make it as close to the transformed size of the image for the rotation case. For this reason I have included an if condition which checks if sin(theta) > 1/sqrt(2) to make sure we are always scaling up the overall window size for the new image.\n",
    "3. Then I begin by create a list of the original coordinates for each pixel, which are relative to the center of the image, and then apply the transformation matrix to each pixelâ€™s coordinate.\n",
    "4. I then adjust the transformed coordinates back for the new image's dimensions and map them to the new image space by subtracting from the new center.\n",
    "5. After this when putting the pixel values for the image I check the bounds so that the image doesn't clip and so that I don't get an out of bounds issue."
